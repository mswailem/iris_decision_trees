This is a quick code I wrote to learn about decision trees. It is a simple implementation of a decision tree the can classify the Iris dataset using Python.

To run the code, you need to have installed the libraries which could be done using:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

then run the python file in the folder called src

TODO:
- Seperate the visualization and training code
- Add a software application that uses the trained tree to classify new data
- More In the future
